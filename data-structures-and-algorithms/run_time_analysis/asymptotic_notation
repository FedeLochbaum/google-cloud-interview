Asymptotic notation ( how fast a function grows with the input size )

* Big Theta ->  Asymptotically TIGHT bound

For example, the worst csase running time of binary search is Theta ( log_a n )

Θ(1)
Θ ( log ⁡ 2 n )
Θ(n)
Θ ( n log ⁡ 2 n )
Θ(n^2 )
Θ ( n^2 log ⁡ 2 n )
Θ ( n^3 )
Θ ( 2^n )
Θ ( n! )

* Big O ( O ) - How the run time increases ( represents the worst case )

- "the running time grows at most this much, but it could grow more slowly"
- We use big-O notation for asymptotic UPPER bounds
- Big-O notation gives only an asymptotic upper bound, and not an asymptotically tight bound

* Big Omega notation

- When we want to say that an algorithm takes at least a certain amount of time, we use big omega
- We use big omega notation for asymptotic LOWER bounds


Selection sort is O(n^2)
