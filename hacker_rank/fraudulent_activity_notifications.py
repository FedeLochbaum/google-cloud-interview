# HackerLand National Bank has a simple policy for warning clients about possible fraudulent account activity.
# If the amount spent by a client on a particular day is greater than or equal to  the client's median spending
# for a trailing number of days, they send the client a notification about potential fraud.
# The bank doesn't send the client any notifications until they have at least that trailing number of prior days' transaction data.

# Given the number of trailing days  and a client's total daily expenditures for a period of  days,
# determine the number of times the client will receive a notification over all  days.

# Example


# On the first three days, they just collect spending data. At day , trailing expenditures are .
# The median is  and the day's expenditure is . Because , there will be a notice. The next day,
# trailing expenditures are  and the expenditures are . This is less than  so no notice will be sent.
# Over the period, there was one notice sent.

# Note: The median of a list of numbers can be found by first sorting the numbers ascending.
# If there is an odd number of values, the middle one is picked. If there is an even number of values,
# the median is then defined to be the average of the two middle values. (Wikipedia)

# Function Description

# Complete the function activityNotifications in the editor below.

# activityNotifications has the following parameter(s):

# int expenditure[n]: daily expenditures
# int d: the lookback days for median spending
# Returns

# int: the number of notices sent
# Input Format

# The first line contains two space-separated integers  and ,
# the number of days of transaction data, and the number of trailing days' data used to calculate median spending respectively.
# The second line contains  space-separated non-negative integers where each integer  denotes .

# Determine the total number of  the client receives over a period of  days. For the first five days, the customer receives no notifications because the bank has insufficient transaction data: .

# On the sixth day, the bank has  days of prior transaction data, , and  dollars. The client spends  dollars, which triggers a notification because : .

# On the seventh day, the bank has  days of prior transaction data, , and  dollars. The client spends  dollars, which triggers a notification because : .

# On the eighth day, the bank has  days of prior transaction data, , and  dollars. The client spends  dollars, which does not trigger a notification because : .

# On the ninth day, the bank has  days of prior transaction data, , and a transaction median of  dollars. The client spends  dollars, which does not trigger a notification because : .

# There are  days of data required so the first day a notice might go out is day . Our trailing expenditures are  with a median of  The client spends  which is less than  so no notification is sent.
