# An English text needs to be encrypted using the following encryption scheme.
# First, the spaces are removed from the text. Let  be the length of this text.
# Then, characters are written into a grid, whose rows and columns have the following constraints:

# Example


# After removing spaces, the string is  characters long.  is between  and , so it is written in the form of a grid with 7 rows and 8 columns.

# ifmanwas  
# meanttos          
# tayonthe  
# groundgo  
# dwouldha  
# vegivenu  
# sroots
# Ensure that 
# If multiple grids satisfy the above conditions, choose the one with the minimum area, i.e. .
# The encoded message is obtained by displaying the characters of each column, with a space between column texts. The encoded message for the grid above is:

# imtgdvs fearwer mayoogo anouuio ntnnlvt wttddes aohghn sseoau

# Create a function to encode a message.

# Function Description

# Complete the encryption function in the editor below.

# encryption has the following parameter(s):

# string s: a string to encrypt
# Returns

# string: the encrypted string
# Input Format

# One line of text, the string 

# Constraints


#  contains characters in the range ascii[a-z] and space, ascii(32).
