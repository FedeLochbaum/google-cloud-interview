# Given an iterator of iterators, implement an interleaving iterator
# Background: Iterator defined

# In object-oriented programming, the iterator pattern is a design pattern in which an iterator is used to traverse a container and access the container's elements.
# The iterator pattern decouples algorithms from containers; in some cases, algorithms are necessarily container-specific and thus cannot be decoupled. This code snippet illustrates:

# Your challenge, should you choose to accept it...
# Given an iterator of iterators, implement an interleaving iterator that takes in an iterator of iterators, and emits elements from the nested iterators in interleaved order. That is, if we had the iterators i and j iterating over the elements [ia, ib, ic] and [ja, jb] respectively, the order in which your interleaving iterator should emit the elements would be [ia, ja, ib, jb, ic].

# Your interleaving iterator should implement the Iterator interface, take in the iterator of iterators in its constructor, and provide the next and hasNext methods. Assume that there are no additional methods offered by the iterator.

# Given the following three iterators put into an array of iteratorsâ€¦
